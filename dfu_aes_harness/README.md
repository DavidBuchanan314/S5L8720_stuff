This directory contains a mismash of code from openiboot, s5l8720-securerom-dumper, and maybe other things too.

As such, consider it GPL3 licensed.

Sorry it's not better documented what comes from where, I didn't initially plan on making it public.

In its current state, I believe its set up to try to do AES DFA against the GID key (bring your own hardware glitches!)

There are also some hardcoded offsets for the "new" ipod2g bootrom.

Although right now it doesn't even compile. ymmv.
